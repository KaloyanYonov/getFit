# GetFit

A React project that helps people create their training program.

A user could decide whether they want to start bulking or cutting and the project helps them with their
training schedule and diet (not fully yet, a lot of things are incomplete).

If a user dosn't know what to do, he can fill a form to calculate their BMI and we will give feedback.

### TODO :

Either localStorage save or save as PNG/JPG.

Cutting part of the project.

More food elements.

Need to start animations soon.
